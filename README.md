# :sparkles: 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console :sparkles:

## :bulb: Purpose (description of project)

This particular project is a small, but important piece of a large puzzle. We are writing a command interpreter to manage our upcoming AirBnB clone projects.

## :star: Description (of command interpreter)
### Information (how to start it, how to use it)
Objectives of the project are to:
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### Examples
```
To be determined.
```
